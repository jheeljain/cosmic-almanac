      <p>
        The Indian Panchang, or Hindu calendar, is often misunderstood as purely mythological or religious. 
        In reality, it is a sophisticated and ancient scientific system for tracking time. The Panchang is a 
        <strong>lunisolar</strong> calendar, meaning it carefully synchronizes both the Moon's phases and the Sun's movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ancient Indian astronomers developed precise mathematical methods to calculate <em>Tithi</em> (lunar day), 
        <em>Nakshatra</em> (the Moon's position among 27 constellations), and even added an extra month 
        (<em>Adhika Maas</em>) every few years to keep the calendar in harmony with the solar yearâ€”much like 
        the leap year in the Western calendar.
      </p>
      <p>
        These calculations were based on real astronomical observations, not just tradition. Many Indian festivals 
        and rituals are set according to the actual positions of the Sun, Moon, and stars, ensuring they stay 
        aligned with natural cosmic cycles.

          <strong>The Panchang's scientific foundation shows that what is often labeled as "mythology" is, 
          in fact, a reflection of India's rich legacy of astronomy and mathematicsâ€”bridging culture, 
          science, and the cosmos.</strong>
